# Problem: get_game_state is not defined in routes/state.py

## Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error occurs when requesting the `/state` endpoint. The error traceback reveals that the function `get_game_state` is called in `routes/state.py` but is not defined or imported, resulting in a `NameError`.

## Log Excerpt
```
NameError: name 'get_game_state' is not defined
```

## Solution Suggestion
- Ensure that `get_game_state` is either properly implemented in `routes/state.py`, or is imported from the correct module (e.g., `game/manager.py`), or use the method from the `game_manager` instance if applicable.
- Example fix (if a method on `game_manager`):
  ```python
  game_manager = current_app.config["game_manager"]
  grid, visions, statuses, global_game_over = game_manager.get_game_state()
  ```

## Next Steps
- Identify if `get_game_state` is defined elsewhere in the codebase.
- Update the Flask route to use the correct reference.
- Restart the server and re-test the endpoint.
